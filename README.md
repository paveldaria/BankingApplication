# Banking Application
This is a Java-based banking application with a graphical user interface (GUI).     
I developed this appllication using the JavaFX framework.

Users can log in as an Admin or a Client. 

If you log in as an Admin, you can:
- create new clients (each client will have a Checking Account and a Savings Account)
- deposit funds into clients' accounts

If you log in as a Client, you can:
- view the balance in Checking Account and Savings Account
- deposit funds
- withdraw funds
- transfer funds between Checking Account and Savings Account
- transfer funds to other clients of the bank 

All client and account information is stored in a database.

If you want to test the application, you can log in as an admin using the following authentication credentials:    
username: Admin   
password: 123456    
If you want to log in as a client, you can create new clients from the Admin account and log in using the new accounts you've created, or you can use the following account:   
username: dariapavel   
password: 123456   

You can find more authentication credentials in the database.   


Below you can see some views of the application:
